          <h1>Important Things to Consider</h1>

          <h2>Consider whether Early Check is the right fit for your family</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Some parents want to know right away, before most symptoms start, if their baby has a serious health
              condition. Knowing early may allow earlier and better treatment.</li>
            <li>Other parents may prefer to wait and only test if their baby has symptoms of a health condition.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Here are some important things to consider:</h2>

          <h3>Early Check is a research study.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you sign up your baby for Early Check, you are joining a research study. The goal of Early Check is
              to learn about acceptable ways to find serious health conditions in babies so they can get help sooner.
            </li>
            <li>You can withdraw at any time. If you’d like to withdraw, contact us at any time. If the baby’s Early
              Check screening test has already been done, we’ll still contact you if the screening test is <span
                class="text-decoration-underline">not</span>
              normal.</li>
            <li>Early Check has the right to withdraw participants if needed before the screening tests have been run.
              If this happens, parents will be notified by email.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Early Check testing is free.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Early Check is free. Early Check will not charge you or your insurance plan for Early Check screening.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If your baby gets a result from a screening test that is <span class="text-decoration-underline">not</span>
            normal, Early Check will confirm the
            result for free.</p>

                          not pay for doctor and specialist office visits or treatments for the baby.</li>

          <h3>Screening tests are not perfect.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Early Check screening will not find all health conditions in all babies.</li>
            <li>If Early Check finds a potential health condition in a baby, follow-up testing is done to learn more.
            </li>
            <li>All babies are different. For babies with the health conditions screened through Early Check, the study
              team and doctors will not know exactly when their symptoms will start and how severe the symptoms will be.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Early Check is not a substitute for standard newborn screening.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Early Check is not the same as standard North Carolina newborn screening. Learn more about North
              Carolina newborn screening below.

                      <p>North Carolina newborn screening is a free program.</p>
                      <p>In the hospital or birthing center, a nurse or other healthcare professional will prick the
                        baby’s heel with a small needle to collect a few drops of blood. The hospital sends the drops of
                        blood to the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health (NCSLPH) in Raleigh for testing.
                        Basic information about the baby, such as date of birth, sex, and birth weight, is also sent.
                      </p>
                      <p>This is the same blood sample that will be used for Early Check screening tests. Early Check
                        also uses this basic information about the baby to make sure the screening result is as accurate
                        as possible.</p>
                      <p>You can learn more about standard newborn screening in North Carolina <a

            <li>If you choose not to join Early Check, your baby will still have standard North Carolina newborn
              screening and follow up.</li>
            <li>It would be very rare, but it is possible that a baby could have a health problem found on standard
              newborn screening and <strong class="text-primary">also</strong> have an Early Check screening test that
              was not normal. If this ever happens,
              the Early Check team will tell the newborn screening professionals and doctors caring for the baby to make
              sure the baby has coordinated care</li>
            <li>Early Check uses DNA sequencing to test for many of the conditions that are also tested by standard
              newborn screening. Because Early Check and standard newborn screening test for these conditions in
              different ways, it’s possible that the results will not match. Finding and explaining those mismatches is
              one of the research goals. The Early Check team will explain any mismatches to the family.</li>
