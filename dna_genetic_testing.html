            <h1>DNA and Genetic Testing</h1>
            <h2>Genetic Testing</h2>
            <p>Your blood and tissue samples contain genes that are made of DNA unique to you. Early Check tests your baby’s DNA for serious health conditions. Only the screening tests described here will be done on your baby. No other tests will be done on your baby’s DNA unless your doctor requests it.</p>
            <p>Your doctor may request further DNA testing based on a change in your child’s health status. The Early Check research team will consider this request and will only test further if we agree with your doctor’s request.</p>
            <h3>Sharing Genetic Information</h3>
            <p>If you agree to take part in this study, Early Check may share de-identified genetic information with other researchers and partnering companies. This allows Early Check to help research all over the country. We will not share anything that can connect de-identified information to you or your baby.</p>
            <p>Deidentified data from this study shared with other researchers and partnering companies will be stored for at least 3 years after the end of the study.</p>
            <h4>Partners</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong class="text-primary">GeneDx:</strong> GeneDx is a genetic testing company and a leader in delivering improved health outcomes through genetic testing. In partnership with Early Check, GeneDx will provide genetic sequencing, analysis, and interpretation of the results. </li>
              <li><strong class="text-primary">Illumina:</strong> Illumina is a biotechnology company that develops, makes and markets systems for genetic testing. Illumina will provide sequencing products that will allow Early Check to test babies as part of the partnership with Early Check. </li>
              <li><strong class="text-primary">ClinVar:</strong> ClinVar is a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human variation and phenotype evidence.  </li>
              <li><strong class="text-primary">dbGap:</strong> dbGaP is a database of genotypes and phenotypes maintained by the National Institutes of Health that was developed to store and share the data and results from studies that have investigated how changes in genes can affect health. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Scientific Databases</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>To do more powerful research, it is helpful for researchers to share information they get from studying human samples. They do this by putting it into one or more scientific databases, where it is stored along with information from other studies. Researchers can then study the combined information to learn even more about health and disease.</li>
              <li>Researchers who have access to a scientific database may be able to see and use your de-identified information, along with information from many other people. Your name and other information that could directly identify you, like address or social security number, will never be placed into a scientific database.</li>
              <li>There are many types of scientific databases. Some are maintained by this institution. Some are maintained by the federal government or private companies.</li>
              <li>For example, the National Institutes of Health (NIH, an agency of the federal government) maintains a database called “dbGaP.” A researcher who wants to study information in dbGaP must apply to the database. Different databases have different ways of reviewing such requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Are there any risks?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Because your genetic information is unique to you, there is a small chance that someone could trace it back to you. The risk of this happening is very small but may grow in the future as technology advances. Researchers will always have a duty to protect your privacy and to keep your information confidential.</li>
              <li>A federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. GINA also does not protect you against discrimination based on an already-diagnosed genetic condition or disease.</li>
